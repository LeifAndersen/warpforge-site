Ecosystem
=========

This section of the documentation contains information about other parts of the ecosystem around `warpforge`.

While `warpforge` itself focuses on providing environment control and enabling any kind of work to be done reliably,
and remains studiously unopinated about what kind of content it processes...
when it's time to get work done, there's a lot of questions that need answering about how things are compiled,
how they're linked together, and how they're made available in a working system.
Those are questions that other tools in the ecosystem -- like [`linkwarp`](./linkwarp/) -- answer.
_Optionally._

There's also a large suite of packages that have been produced in `warpforge`,
and contain software that you can easily use within `warpforge` to get more work done.
(Things like python, gcc, etc -- these and more are available as packages
that are named and tracked in [catalogs](/glossary.md#catalog),
and ready to go just as easily as putting their name in an input spec!)
We keep these independent of `warpforge` itself, but you can get them
by using the [warpsys](./warpsys/) catalog.

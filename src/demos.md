Demo videos
-----------

Here's some nice videos of `warpforge` doing its thing:

- Using the quickstart and writing a module:
    
    [Warpforge Quickstart Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/ax3iU4aRu17Cx4CG1OYBNCPb6)
    
- Adding content to a catalog from the web:
    
    [Plot Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/XL03vvethmuqnA1iNJx2xDsRD)
    
- Compute using hashes — this is the low-level API on display:
    
    [Formula Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/FY4iYhlEi5m0h78oFYqqvIZYc)
    
- Awk in a box!  This is what it looks like to combine a tool and a dataset (think: reproducible scientific compute, or distributable bigdata jobs):

You can also find lots of complete examples in the

of the project repo — check ‘em out!



Real world software built with Warpforge
----------------------------------------

Real world Warpforge usage can be seen in two forms:
Catalogs -- which contain info about released stuff --
and Workspaces -- which are 

### The Warpsys Catalog

The Warpsys Catalog is a public catalog of software built using Warpforge, and (mostly) using the [Zapps](https://zapps.app/) linking conventions.

For example, you can find packages of software such as Bash, Python, Emacs, Helix, and many more there.

This catalog is rendered to the web at [**https://catalog.warpsys.org/**](https://catalog.warpsys.org/).

The raw form of this catalog can also be found as JSON files in git, on github: [github.com/warptools/catalog](https://github.com/warptools/catalog).

### Real Workspaces

The instructions to produce the stuff found released in the Warpsys catalog are all here:

[**https://github.com/warptools/warpsys**](https://github.com/warptools/warpsys)

This source code repo contains one large a "workspace".
Within it, there's lots of "modules", each generally producing one piece of software.

Note that this is an example of a pretty large workspace.
Other workspaces may have only a single module in them, and be quite simpler!

### Other Catalogs and Workspaces

Other catalogs and workspaces might be found in other places around the internet!

There is nothing special nor blessed about the "warpsys" catalog or workspace.

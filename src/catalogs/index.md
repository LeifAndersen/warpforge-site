Catalogs
========

This section of the documentation regards [Catalogs](/glossary.md#catalog), which are the structure that organizes data and human-readable labelling on data handled by `warpforge`. 
(We have separate sections for the `warpforge` tool itself, and for other pieces of tooling in the ecosystem, but Catalogs are important enough to deserve a whole set of pages just to themselves!)

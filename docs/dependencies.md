# Dependencies
Yes, sometimes dependencies are a pain, but they are needed, so here's a small rundown on how to update the packages fairly simply.

1. run `npm outdated` to check if there's any updates to be done
2. run `npx npm-check-updates -u` to update all the packages in our package.json to the latest versions
3. please run `npm run serve` and check so everything is running and still looks good after the update is done.
4. push your changes to git 👏
